# Persian Calendar Model for Metabase

A Metabase model that converts Gregorian dates to the Persian (Jalali) calendar system, providing additional calendar features like seasons, week start dates, and Persian month names.

## Why This Project Was Developed?
In the world of **product management** and data analytics, **misalignment between analytical infrastructure and business realities** can lead to poor decision-making. A common challenge in business reporting is aligning analytical systems with real-world operational calendars. Many businesses operate on the **Jalali (Shamsi/Persian) calendar system**, Many businesses operate on the **Jalali (Shamsi/Persian) calendar system**, yet most data analytics tools primarily support the **Gregorian calendar** only.

As a Product Leader working at the intersection of business strategy and data-driven decision-making, I personally faced this challenge when trying to align analytical reports with real-world business cycles. Despite searching for a solution, I found that the **Metabase community** had raised this issue but no concrete solution was available. Realizing that this was a shared challenge among product professionals, I decided to develop a comprehensive solution that everyone could benefit from.
